# What is Data Science?

Beyond the Buzzwords

## The Intersection of Statistics & Engineering

<br><br>

> Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.

## Definition?



## Jacks of All (Data) Trades

Some common themes:

-   It involves drawing complex insights from large amounts of data
-   It combines elements of statistics, data analytics, software engineering, data engineering, and research science
-   The potential skillset is so wide that it is better to think of a team of scientists covering all bases

## Drawing Complex Insights

:::

-   Data Science has **some** overlap with AI, but they are not the same thing.
    -   It's not robots and self-driving cars!
-   Machine Learning and Deep Learning are methods a data scientist could use to find a solution to a business problem

# The Data Science Skillset

What Does a Data Scientist Look Like?

## Foundational Skills

-   Math - Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability & Statistics
-   Computer Science - Programming, Software Engineering, Data Management
-   Research - Scientific Reasoning & Communication, Quantitative Methods, Research Design
<br><br><br>
-   ... It is more than just coding!

## Soft Skills

-   Curiosity
-   Creativity
-   Communication Skills

## Domains of Data Science

-   Machine Learning
-   Deep Learning
-   Decision Optimisation
-   Statistical Inference
<br><br><br>
-   Plus Lots More... (Some of Which Haven't Been Invented Yet!)

# Data Science in the NHS (and SCW)

Why do we need it?

## Technological Advancements

-   The exponential growth in the availability (and complexity) of data has meant a need for going further than descriptive analytics
    -   Complex statistical models that replicate the complex data generating process
-   The exponential growth in computing power has made these complex statistical models accessible beyond the tech industry and computer science research

## Keeping Up with the Joneses

-   Every industry is experiencing these technological advancements
    -   Some industries are utilising it slower than others
-   The NHS has a lot of data, and using it effectively serves significant public good
-   Every CSU will realise this (if they haven't already)

# Use Cases

## Machine Learning

Predicting Heart Disease

-   Supervised machine learning problem - classification
-   Tabular data - probably use a gradient boosting model
-   Could help to identify and prioritize high risk cases

## Deep Learning

Identifying symptoms of diabetic retinopathy from retinal scans

-   Using unstructured data (images), requires a deep learning approach
-   Convolutional neural networks have had success in this domain
-   Could significantly reduce the grading workload

## Decision Optimisation

Assigning resources within a hospital based on forecasted demands

-   Agent-based modeling?
-   Forecasting?
-   Could reduce waiting times in hospitals

## Statistical Inference

Understanding the role that deprivation plays in health outcomes

-   Hierarchical data structure with complex causal pathways
-   Bayesian Mixed Models
-   Could help us better understand what role social factors play in health outcomes
    -   Leading to better policy interventions!
