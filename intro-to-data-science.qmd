# What is Data Science?

Beyond the Buzzwords

## A New Field Built on Old Traditions

## The Intersection of Statistics & Engineering

<br><br>

> Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.

## Jacks of All (Data) Trades

Some common themes:

-   It involves drawing complex insights from large amounts of data
-   It combines elements of statistics, data analytics, software engineering, data engineering, and research science
-   The potential skill set is so wide that this is usually served by multiple people in a data science team

## Drawing Complex Insights

## AI â‰  Machine Learning â‰  Data Science

:::

-   Data science leverages approaches to AI, including ML and DL, to find solutions to business problems
-   But there are often simpler solutions
-   And there are lots of problems for which ML and DL are not appropriate

# The Data Science Skillset

What Does a Data Scientist Look Like?

## Dall-E Mini's 'Data Scientist'

## Foundational Skills

-   Math - Linear algebra, calculus, probability & statistics
-   Computer Science - Programming, software engineering, data management
-   Research - Scientific reasoning & communication, quantitative methods, research design
<br><br><br>
... It is more than just coding!

## Soft Skills are Equally as Important!

There is more to data science than the technical skills.

For example:

-   Curiosity
-   Creativity
-   Communication Skills
-   Storytelling
-   Critical Thinking

Most of all, a passion for finding solutions to complex problems!

## (Some) Domains of Data Science

-   Machine Learning - Supervised learning (regression/classification), unsupervised learning (clustering)
-   Deep Learning - Computer vision, natural language processing
-   Decision Optimisation - Discrete event simulation, agent-based simulation
-   Statistical Inference - Bayesian statistics, causal inference, time series forecasting

Plus much, much more...

# Data Science in the NHS

Why do we need it?

## Technological Advancements

-   The exponential growth in the availability (and complexity) of data demands a more complex approach than descriptive analytics
    -   Statistical models that replicate the complex data generating process
-   The exponential growth in computing power has made these complex statistical models accessible beyond the tech industry and computer science research

## Keeping Up with the Joneses

-   Every industry is experiencing these technological advancements
    -   Some industries are utilising it slower than others
-   The NHS has a lot of data, and using it effectively serves significant public good
-   Every CSU will realise this (if they haven't already)

# Potential Use Cases

Where Can (and Has) Data Science Been Applied in Healthcare?

## Machine Learning

Predicting Heart Disease

-   Supervised machine learning problem - classification
-   Tabular data - probably use a gradient boosting model
-   Could help to identify and prioritize high risk cases

## Deep Learning

Identifying symptoms of diabetic retinopathy from retinal scans

-   Using unstructured data (images), requires a deep learning approach
-   Convolutional neural networks have had success in this domain
-   Could significantly reduce the grading workload

## Decision Optimisation

Assigning resources within a hospital based on forecasted demands

-   Agent-based modeling?
-   Forecasting?
-   Could reduce waiting times in hospitals and use staff resources more efficiently

## Statistical Inference
